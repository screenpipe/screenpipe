## New Features
- Smart transcription mode: meeting detection defers Whisper during video calls (Zoom, Meet, Teams, etc.) and processes audio backlog when the meeting ends
- Health API now reports meeting detection state (`meeting_detected`, `meeting_app`) in smart mode

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed codesign failure on self-hosted macOS runners (unlocked login keychain for cert chain verification)
- Fixed short API key validation for custom providers like Ollama
