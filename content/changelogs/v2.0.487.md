## Performance Improvements

- Reuse Whisper GPU state across audio segments instead of reallocating ~200MB Metal buffers per segment — significantly reduces GPU contention during Zoom calls and other continuous speech
- Reduce FTS indexing batch size to minimize database write lock hold time
- Fix database write semaphore bypass that allowed uncontrolled concurrent writers
- Add row limits to timeline streaming queries to prevent unbounded result sets
- Merge audio chunk + transcription into single database transaction, halving lock acquisitions

## Improvements

- Split UI event settings into separate input capture and accessibility toggles
- Align search shortcut default to Alt+K on Windows across tray, store, and frontend

## Bug Fixes

- Fix macOS CI codesigning for self-hosted runners
