screenpipe provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude and Cursor search your screen recordings, audio transcriptions, and control your computer.

## claude desktop

open the **screenpipe app** → **settings** → **connections** → click **"install extension"**

Claude will open and prompt you to confirm. click **install** — done!

try asking Claude: *"what did I do in the last 5 minutes?"*

<Tip>
make sure screenpipe is running when you use Claude with screenpipe features.
</Tip>

## claude code

one command:

```bash
claude mcp add screenpipe --transport stdio -- npx -y screenpipe-mcp
```

to make it available across all your projects:

```bash
claude mcp add screenpipe --transport stdio --scope user -- npx -y screenpipe-mcp
```

verify with `claude mcp list` or `/mcp` inside Claude Code.

## cursor

[click here to install in cursor](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=screenpipe&config=eyJ0eXBlIjoic3RkaW8iLCJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsInNjcmVlbnBpcGUtbWNwIl19)

or manually: open **cursor settings** → **mcp** → **add new global mcp server** → set command to `npx` with args `["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]`.

## other editors (cline, continue, windsurf, etc.)

any editor that supports MCP works with screenpipe. the server command is:

```bash
npx -y screenpipe-mcp
```

add this as a stdio MCP server in your editor's MCP settings. see also:
- [continue setup](/continue)
- [cline setup](/cline)

## available tools

### search-content (all platforms)

search through recorded screen content, audio transcriptions, and user input events:

| parameter | type | description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `q` | string | search query (optional - omit to get recent content) |
| `content_type` | string | `all`, `ocr`, `audio`, `input`, or `accessibility` (default: `all`) |
| `limit` | integer | max results (default: 10) |
| `offset` | integer | pagination offset (default: 0) |

### export-video

create video exports from screen recordings for a specific time range:

| parameter | type | description |

| `start_time` | string | ISO 8601 UTC start time (required) |
| `end_time` | string | ISO 8601 UTC end time (required) |
| `fps` | number | frames per second (default: 1.0) |

## example queries

try these in Claude or Cursor:

- "search for any mentions of 'project' in my screen recordings"
- "find audio transcriptions from the last hour"
- "show me what was on my screen in VS Code yesterday"
- "export a video of my screen from 10am to 11am today"
- "find what John said in our meeting about the API"
- "what did I type in Slack today?" (uses content_type=input)
- "what did I copy to my clipboard recently?" (uses content_type=input)

## testing

test your setup with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx screenpipe-mcp
```

## requirements

- screenpipe must be running on localhost:3030
- Node.js >= 18.0.0

## manual config (advanced)

<Expandable title="manual JSON configuration">

if the one-click methods above don't work, you can manually edit config files.

**claude desktop** — edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**cursor** — create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe
cd screenpipe/crates/screenpipe-integrations/screenpipe-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

then point your editor to `node /path/to/screenpipe-mcp/dist/index.js`.

</Expandable>

## troubleshooting

**mcp not connecting?**
- ensure screenpipe is running (`screenpipe` in terminal)
- check it's accessible at http://localhost:3030/health
- restart Claude Desktop / Cursor after config changes

**macos automation not working?**
- grant accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
