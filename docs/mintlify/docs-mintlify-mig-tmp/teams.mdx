teams let admins push pipe configurations and recording filters to all members. everything is end-to-end encrypted using AES-256-GCM — the screenpipe server never sees your configs in plaintext.

## what you can share

## how security works

teams use **AES-256-GCM** encryption. the encryption key is generated on the admin's device and never sent to our server. members receive the key through the invite link (shared out-of-band via a secure channel like slack DM or signal).

<Steps>
  <Step title="admin creates a team">
    a 256-bit AES-GCM key is generated locally using the Web Crypto API. this key is stored in the Tauri secure store (`~/.screenpipe/store.bin`) — not in localStorage or anywhere web-accessible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="admin shares invite link">
    the invite link contains the team ID and the base64-encoded encryption key: `screenpipe://join-team?team_id=...&key=...`. this is the only time the key is transmitted — via the link itself, not through our server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="members join and store the key">
    when a member opens the invite link, the key is imported and stored in their local Tauri secure store. our server only records the membership — it never sees the key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="configs are encrypted before upload">
    when an admin pushes a pipe or filter config, it's encrypted locally with AES-256-GCM using a random 12-byte nonce. only the encrypted blob and nonce are sent to the server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="members decrypt locally">
    team members download the encrypted configs and decrypt them on-device using the shared key. decrypted configs are applied to local settings automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## what the server stores vs what it can see

| data | stored on server | readable by server |
|------|:---:|:---:|
| team name & member list | yes | yes |
| encrypted config blobs | yes | **no** |
| encryption nonces | yes | yes (but useless without key) |
| encryption key | **no** | **no** |
| decrypted pipe configs | **no** | **no** |
| decrypted filter lists | **no** | **no** |

## getting started

### create a team (admin)

1. go to **settings > team**
2. enter a team name and click **create team**
3. copy the invite link and share it with your team via a secure channel

<Warning>
the invite link contains your encryption key. share it only through a secure channel (e.g. signal, slack DM, in-person). anyone with this link can join and decrypt your team's configs.
</Warning>

### join a team (member)

1. open the invite link — screenpipe will handle it automatically via deep link
2. alternatively, go to **settings > team** and paste the invite link manually

### push filters to team (admin)

1. go to **settings > recording** and scroll to **filtering**
2. set up your ignored windows, included windows, or ignored URLs
3. click the **push to team** button on any filter card

pushed filters appear under the **team** tab and are automatically synced to all members.

### share a pipe to team (admin)

1. go to **settings > pipes**
2. click the **share** button next to any pipe
3. the pipe config (including its prompt and schedule) is encrypted and pushed to the team

<Info>
if you update a pipe locally and share it again, the team copy is overwritten with your latest version. the model is last-push-wins — there's no merge.
</Info>

### how filters sync for members

when a member visits the team tab, shared filters are automatically merged into their local recording settings:

- **team filters are additive** — they're combined with the member's own filters, not replaced
- **team-sourced entries show a badge** in the recording settings so members know which filters come from the team
- **members can't remove team filters** from their local settings while they're in the team — leaving the team clears them

## roles

| action | admin | member |
|--------|:-----:|:------:|
| create/delete team | yes | no |
| invite members | yes | no |
| remove members | yes | no |
| push configs (pipes, filters) | yes | no |
| delete shared configs | yes | no |
| receive shared configs | yes | yes |
| leave team | yes | yes |

## requirements

- screenpipe account (sign in at **settings > team**)
- screenpipe desktop app (teams use the Tauri secure store for key storage)

## technical details

- **encryption**: AES-256-GCM via the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)
- **key storage**: Tauri plugin-store (`~/.screenpipe/store.bin`), not localStorage
- **nonce**: 12-byte random per encryption operation (crypto.getRandomValues)
- **config types**: `pipe`, `window_filter`, `url_filter` (extensible)
- **sync**: automatic when the team tab loads; filter configs merge into local settings via the `useTeamSync` hook

## faq

**what happens if i lose the invite link?**
the admin can always copy it again from **settings > team**. the encryption key is stored locally on the admin's device.

**can the screenpipe team read my configs?**
no. the server only stores encrypted blobs. the encryption key is never transmitted to our server.

**what if two admins push the same pipe name?**
last push wins. the newer version overwrites the older one. there's no merge or conflict resolution — the pipe is treated as a single document.

**what happens when i leave a team?**
all team-sourced filters are removed from your local settings. your personal filters remain unchanged.

**is the encryption key rotated?**
not currently. if you suspect the key is compromised, delete the team and create a new one with a fresh key.
