Highlight Keywords That are Searched
**describe the feature**
When I search for a keyword in my history, I would like screenpipe to highlight where it is found in the page.

**why is this needed?**
It makes it a lot easier to locate the context of the search. It answers the question: Why did screenpipe say that this keyword is in this screenshot? 

**alternatives considered**
Not really

**additional context**
