# Coding-agent regression evals

This is an agent eval suite, not a unit-test suite. Every case contains:

- a sanitized task derived from an escaped product failure;
- the historical broken repository revision;
- an isolated trial workspace with no future git history;
- a hidden deterministic outcome grader materialized only after the agent stops;
- saved prompt, transcript, candidate patch, grader output, runtime fingerprint, and result;
- repeated-trial reporting with success rate, `pass@k`, and `pass^k`.

The current app corpus contains 10 git-mined regressions. See
[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for the Anthropic guidance, source contract, and
history-mining workflow. The companion website manifest contributes 10 more.

The product tests referenced by the manifest are graders. Passing them directly is not the eval; the evaluated object is an agent trajectory and resulting patch from the historical broken state.

## Validate the corpus

```bash
node evals/coding-agent/run.mjs --validate
node evals/coding-agent/run.mjs --verify
```

`--verify` proves each historical base fails its hidden grader and its known fix passes. A case is invalid if either side of that contrast is missing.

## Run agent trials

```bash
node evals/coding-agent/run.mjs \
  --case app-chat-concurrent-save \
  --trials 3 \
  --agent-command 'codex exec --ephemeral --approve-for-me --json -C {workspace} - < {prompt_file}'
```

The agent receives only the task and archived broken tree. It does not receive the oracle commit, grader definition, or future repository history.

Results are written under `evals/coding-agent/results/` unless `--results-dir` is supplied. Use `--keep` only for debugging a failed trial.

Agent-process and harness failures are reported as `error` and excluded from
the success denominator. They are never silently converted into model failures.

The same runner can score another checkout and manifest with `--repo` and
`--manifest`; the website corpus uses this so both repositories share exactly
one harness implementation.

## Modes

- `agent`: run the configured coding agent and grade its patch.
- `baseline`: make no change and grade the broken revision.
- `oracle`: apply the historical fix and grade it.
- `regrade`: apply a saved `candidate.patch` and run the current grader without another model call.
- `--verify`: require baseline failure plus oracle success.

Do not turn capability scores into a release gate after one run. Establish matched-environment repeated baselines first. Regression cases intended to block should target reliable `pass^k`, not a lucky `pass@k`.
